### Functionality
[X] There should be a "playing now" song within the player view.
  - Songs that are 'playing now' should be dequeued.
  - 'Now Playing' tag on first in queue as it plays.

(1)Add a router and assign unique URLs to playlists, subpages and/or songs (for example, index.html#songs/:title of the song will play that song).
(2)Implement test and functionality for upvote/downvote next to each song title. Improve your application's UI by adding web fonts and replacing your 'Add to queue" and upvote/downvote buttons with icons.
[X] Show the play count (how many times a given song has been played) next to each song title.
Store application state in localStorage, so it persists after you reload the page.
Convert your app to use AMD by using Require.js. AMD (asynchronous module definition) is a system for loading JavaScript files asynchronously. Underscore and Backbone don't support AMD by default, so you'll need to use modified versions of both.
Make a WebAudio music visualizer. Check out this chapter of the O'Reilly book on Web Audio, and open the Sources tab of DevTools to inspect this example. Put your visualizer in its own Backbone.View!
